<!Project FILES Description>

<h2><p>Project Files Description </p></h2>
<p>This Project Consists of 2 Files</p>
<ul>
  <li>Messages.csv : is a CSV file that stores tabular data(Messages Dataset) in plain text, where each line of the file typically represents one data record(Message). </li>
  <li>SpamFilter.ipnyb : is a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file that contains complete/Non-Redundant records of Messages.csv, including code input and output, narrative texts, and Additional informations that was displayed during the session.</li>
</ul>

<!ALGORITHM APPLIED!!>

<h2><p> Algorithm : Naïve Bayes Classifier</p></h2>
<p><ul>
  <li>Naïve Bayes Classifier is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems.</li>
  <li>Naïve Bayes Classifier helps in building the fast machine learning models that can make quick predictions.</li>
  <li>It is a probabilistic classifier, which means it predicts on the basis of the probability of an object.</li>
Some popular examples of Naïve Bayes Algorithm are spam filtration, Sentimental analysis, and classifying articles.</ul></p>
